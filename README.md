## Project Goals
In this project, you’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.”<br>
The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
